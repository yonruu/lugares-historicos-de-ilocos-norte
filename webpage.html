            <p class="describe">The Saint Augustine Church (Spanish: Iglesia de San Agustín de Paoay), commonly known as
                the Paoay
                Church, is a Roman Catholic church in the municipality of Paoay, Ilocos Norte in the Philippines.
                Completed in 1710, the church is famous for its distinct architecture highlighted by the enormous
                buttresses on the sides and back of the building. It is declared as a National Cultural Treasure by the
                Philippine government in 1973 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the collective group of Baroque
                Churches of the Philippines in 1993.</p>

            <h3 class="descript">Cape Bojeador Lighthouse</h3>
            <p class="describe">Burgos Lighthouse, also called Cape Bojeador Lighthouse, is a cultural landmark.
                construction that dates back to the Spanish colonial era in Burgos, Ilocos Norte
                Philippines. [1][2] Originally lit on March 30, 1892, the lighthouse is situated high on Vigia de
                Nagpartian Hill, with a view of the picturesque Cape Bojeador, where historical galleons formerly
                passed. Following over
                It continues to operate after a century, serving ships that arrive in the Philippine archipelago from
                the north and
                lead them securely off the town's rugged coast. The spot of light indicates the northwest corner of
                Luzon. The Cape Engaño Lighthouse, located on Palaui Island in Santa Ana, Cagayan, is the most
                northeastern point.
                The most noticeable building in the area is the 66-foot-tall (20 m) octagonal stone tower, which may be
                seen
                from as far away as, on a clear day, Bangui on the east and Pasuquin Town on the south. In contrast to
                Contrary to popular perception, it is neither the Philippines' tallest or highest lighthouse; rather, it
                is the
                the nation's highest elevated original Spanish era lighthouse that is still operational. Lighthouse in
                Corregidor
                is taller, standing at more than 600 feet (180 meters), and the lighthouse tower of Cape
                The highest point is the 90-foot (27-meter) Melville Lighthouse. In the Mindoro Strait, the newly
                constructed contemporary
                tower of the Apo Reef Light Station is 110 feet (34 meters) high.</p>

            <h3 class="descript">Sinking Bell Tower</h3>
            <p class="describe">The mysterious Laoag City Bell Tower never fails to pique people's interest.
                traveling to the Philippines' northern region of Ilocos Norte. Its story follows a protracted storyline
                of
                occupation, hardship, and survival—not unlike the story of the nation's ascent and decline under the
                Imperial
                Spain.
                The aboriginal Ilocano ethnic group lived in the coastal Ilocos Region of northwest Philippines, and
                acted as a trading port for the tribal peoples of Indonesia and Malaysia nearby. Having more than a
                thousand
                miles north of the Visayan Islands, the Spanish colonists' first port of entry in 1521, this northern
                This seemed an odd location for Spain to build a stronghold.
                However, 333 years of Spanish domination over the archipelago have left the Spanish cultural and
                religious traditions
                are still in use today in this area as well as many other parts of the Philippines. In addition to these
                The unbreakable constructions that have endured the test of time are known as intangible
                transformations.
                Buildings such as the renowned Sinking Bell Tower, the tallest historic structure in the capital city of
                Laoag City
                of Ilocos Norte.
                Though no one is monitoring it, it's thought that the historic tower is sinking an inch every year.
                fully aware of the reason.

                Amianan)
                A presidential museum called Hilaga is located in Paoay, Ilocos Norte, Philippines. It served as the
                family's home.
                of Ferdinand Marcos during his tenure as Philippine President.
                The Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA), which is currently the Tourism Infrastructure and
                In 1977, in honor of Marcos's 60th birthday, the Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA) functioned as an
                official
                The presidential residence during their stay in Ilocos Norte.
                There are seven rooms in this two-story mansion with a view of Paoay Lake; seven is thought to be a
                lucky number.
                for Marcos rooms, each featuring a historical event theme from the Marcos era
                Diplomacy, agriculture, culture, nation-building, overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), and family.
                TIEZA was in charge of the property when Cecile Licad performed a Frédéric Chopin program there in
                2001.
                Benigno Aquino III, the previous president, gave Ilocos Norte use of the property.
                2010 saw the province government. The land was then owned by Ferdinand Marcos' daughter, Governor Imee
                Marcos.
                Remodeled to become a popular tourist destination in the province. Eric Zerrudo, from Santo André
                University
